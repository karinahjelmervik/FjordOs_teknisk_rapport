\section{Summary and final remarks}
\label{sec:summa}
A new Oslofjord model based on the publically available ocean model ROMS \citep{shche:mcwil:2005,shche:mcwil:2009,haidv:etal:2008} is developed as part of the project FjordOs. The new model, named FjordOs CL, exploits the curvilinear option in ROMS to minimize the number of ``dry'' grid points at the expense of increasing the number of ``wet'' grid points and thereby enhancing the resolution. The resulting FjordOs CL grid is therefore variable with a mesh size varying from about 50 m in the {\DR} area to about 300 m. The highest resolution is in the {\DR} area while the lowest is at the models southern boundary bordering on the Skagerrak.
