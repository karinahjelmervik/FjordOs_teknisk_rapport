Provided is documentation of a new Oslofjord model, FjordOs CL, utilizing the curvilinear option of the Regional Ocean Modeling System - ROMS. The development is part of the project FjordOs. FjordOs CL has a spatial grid size varying from about 50 meters in the {\DR} sound to about 300 meters at its southern open boundary bordering on the Skagerrak. It features 42 terrain-following levels in the vertical. In addition to being forced by atmospheric, river and tidal input it is also forced by oceanic input at the open boundary. The atmospheric input is extracted from MET Norway's operational NWP model (AROME-MetCoOp), while oceanic input is extracted from MET Norway's operational, ocean forecasting model NorKyst800. The river input consists of observational based estimated discharges from 37 rivers along the perimeter of the fjord. The tidal input is based on the TPXO Atlantic database modified by observations and consists of nine tidal constituents as input.
