Provided is a detailed documentation of a new Oslofjord model, FjordOs CL, utilizing the curvilinear option of the Regional Ocean Modeling System - ROMS. The development is part of the project FjordOs. FjordOs CL has a spatial grid size varying from about 50 meters in the {\DR} sound to about 300 meters at its southern open boundary bordering on the Skagerrak. It features 42 terrain-following levels in the vertical. In addition to atmospheric, river and tidal input it is forced by oceanic input at the open boundary. The atmospheric input is extracted from MET Norway's operational NWP model (AROME-MetCoOp). River discharges are from 37 rivers. Ocean input is from MET Norway's operational, ocean forecasting model NorKyst800. Tidal input is based on the TPXO Atlantic database modified by observations and consists of nine tidal constituents as input.
