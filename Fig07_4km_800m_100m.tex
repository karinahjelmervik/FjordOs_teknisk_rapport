  \caption{\small As Figure \ref{fig:resolution}, but zoomed in on Breidangen. To better reveal the grid the underlying map is not shown. (a) 4 km grid, (b) 800 m grid and (c) 100 m grid. Note that it takes a 100 m grid to properly resolve the many islands, narrow straits and channels present in the fjord. }
