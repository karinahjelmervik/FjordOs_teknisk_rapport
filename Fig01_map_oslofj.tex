  \caption{\small The location of the Oslofjord in Southern Norway. The gray scale bar indicates depth in meters. The arrow points to the location of the fjords main $\sim$ 20 m deep sill (enlarged in Figure \ref{fig:droebak_sill}). Note also the $\sim$ 400 m deep deep basin extending from the Skagerrak towards the Hvaler Archipelago in the southeast, the so called Hvalerdjupet. }
