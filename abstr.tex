Provided is a detailed documentation of a new Oslofjord model, FjordOs CL, utilizing the curvilinear option of the Regional Ocean Modeling System - ROMS. The development is part of the project FjordOs. FjordOs CL has a spatial grid size varying from about 50 meters in the {\DR} sound to about 300 meters at its southern open boundary bordering on the Skagerrak. It features 42 terrain-following levels in the vertical. It is forced by atmospheric input, river input, tidal input and ocean input at its open boundary. The atmospheric input is from MET Norway's operational NWP model (AROME-MetCoOp). River input is via 37 rivers based on NIVA's hydrological model and discharge observations. Ocean input is from MET Norway's operational, ocean forecasting model NorKyst800. The tidal input is based on the TPXO Atlantic database modified by observations and provides nine tidal constituents as input.
